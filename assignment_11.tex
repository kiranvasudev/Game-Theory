\section{Implement a Connect-4 game to demonstrate the use of adversarial search for deterministic, fully observable, two player turn-taking zero-sum games. You must implement a minmax and a alpha-beta pruning agent that play against you and each other. Compare these two approaches based on their search time, space requirement and other information that you think is important.}
